Methods

In other languages, functional modules of code are called Functions,
sub-Functions, subroutines.

In Java none of those words are used - they are called Methods.

The "main" method is the entry point into all Java applications.

We can add more methods within the scope of a single class.

In Java there are static methods, and methods that belong to 
objects. We haven't looked at Classes and Objects yet, so there is 
nothing to compare to "static" methods in our learning path.

You don't really know what the static means, but for now, just
understand that static methods are called from static methods.
