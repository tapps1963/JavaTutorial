Summary

Java methods must have:
  Return type - my be void
  Name - using camelCase - containing a verb - the do something
  Parameter list
  
  For now - public static
  
Methods should perform one task that matches their name.

Can be used to break more complex problems into easier problems.

Methods shouldn't be more than a page long - rule of thumb.
