Summary

Java Arras know how many elements the have .length

Space for an Array is allocated dynamically at run-time

The indexes of an array start with 0 (zero)
  Eg. an Array with 10 elements has indexes 0-9
  
Arrays can be of any data type - elements are used if they
are simple variables of that type

Array elements are initialized to 0, 0.0, false or null

A variable can be used in the allocation of space for an array

for (int i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
	array[i] = ....
	
There is a loop in Java for reading arrays. Enhanced for loop, for each
	for( double element : array)
