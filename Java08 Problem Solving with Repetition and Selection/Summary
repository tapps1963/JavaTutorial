Summary

Always have some test cases that demonstrate the expected results for
the problem you are solving.

Develop your solution progressively.

Compile frequently - isolate compile errors.

Use the debugger to find logical errors - the program cannot hide 
anything from you.

Use 'for' loops for counter controlled loops.

Use short-cut operators where possible.

Choose variable name carefully.
