Classes and Objects

It's time to move beyond the use of primatives

A class is a data type: Abstract Data Type, User Defined Data Type

An object is an instance of a class

There can be many objects created from one class, just as there can
be many int variables, double variables, etc.

Think of the class as the blueprint, and the objects are the things
built from the blueprint

This is different from what you've seen before but it is intentionally
designed to be not difficult... Let's just go look at how to do it.
