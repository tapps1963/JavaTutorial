Summary

Any class that has on or more abstract methods is an abstract class.

You cannot make an instance of an abstract class.

Abstract classes still have concrete methods, data, constructors, toString...

Abstract classes 'impose' something on all of the sub classes.

Abstract methods must be overridden by the sub-class.

The name of an abstract class can still be used as a compile-time type.

You can use abstract methods to design the functionality of the sub-class
and then have someone else write the code. (This is mostly done with 
"interfaces" a future topic.)
