Summary

Other than a class the only identifier that starts with a CapitalLetter.

An Interface contains public abstract method signatures.

Interfaces do NOT have concrete methods, data, constructors, toString...

Interfaces do 'impose' something on all classes that agree to implement them.

The name of an interface can be used as a compile-time type.

This is another form of polymorphism. Write a method that takes and object
that is from a class that implements an interface.

In this type of polymorphism, we know something about the object, but we
don't know anything about its inheritance.
