Summary

Compile-time type vs Run-time type - satisfy the compiler first

Dynamic method binding - call the method from the object that you actually 
have, not the method from the Compile-time class

Write methods that can take different kinds of objects based on the data type
of the parameter, i.e. a method that wants you to pass an Animal, you can 
pass anything that IS A Animal. (Polymorphism)

You can use the instance operator to determine what kind of object you
have at runtime.

The equals method - you should override this method. It is expected to be in
your classes
